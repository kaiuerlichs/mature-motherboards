“Mature Motherboards” is a vintage computer shop for enthusiasts and collectors. The company
sells a variety of products, which comprises vintage computers, user guides, upgrade kits and
peripherals. Some products, such as user guides or upgrade kits, are tailored specifically to specific
computer models and are sold alongside them.

We have built a prototype website to help aid in bringing this company into the online world!
